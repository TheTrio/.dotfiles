# LinuxSetup

I no longer use most of the stuff here, primarily because I've now switched to using Mac OS. Some stuff like my terminal and shell configs are still relevant though, which is why I'll keep this around for now

# What it has

Configuration of almost everything I use. Ranging from stuff like Vim, neovim and kitty, to ncspot and tldr. There's also an arch install script which helps me set up my environment on a new machine. GNU stow is used to manage the configuration files.

# Why

Because why not
