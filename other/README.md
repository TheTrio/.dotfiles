# Other scripts

These are scripts/configuration files which I don't sync automatically using GNU stow(mostly because they go in some root folder)

## Mozilla

This has my firefox CSS files to enable vertical tabs and a couple of other visual tweaks

## Loader

I no longer use GRUB so having the systemd boot files around makes things easier.

## Xrandr

KDE manages my monitors well enough. But SDDM doesn't respect those settings. The script is just to make that if I have my external monitor connected, SDDM turns off the laptop monitor and sets the refresh rate of the external one to 75 Hz

## LogiOps

Since logitech despite having a linux driver, doesn't have a GUI for it, I use this to configure my Logitech M337.
